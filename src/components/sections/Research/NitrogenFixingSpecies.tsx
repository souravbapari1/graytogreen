            Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients plants need to grow. To do so,
            they extract inorganic nitrogen from the forest soil. A lot of
            tropical dry forests are Nitrogen limited. That means that the low
            levels of nitrogen is the primary reason plants in that ecosystem
            are not growing faster. So what can be done? Well, there is one
            family of plants with a unique ability. Species in the Fabaceae
            family (also called Legumes) grow small nodules on their roots and
            in those nodules they host special bacteria. These bacteria can fix
            nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into the type of
            nitrogen that plants can use. So while all other plants are
            competing for the limited inorganic nitrogen in the forest soil, the
            Fabaceae species just create their own through this symbiosis.Â
